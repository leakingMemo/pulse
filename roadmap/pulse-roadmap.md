                Background Refresh
```

### Security
- API keys in macOS Keychain

- Local encryption for financial data
- Secure API token refresh

## Success Metrics
- Launch time < 100ms

- Data freshness < 5 minutes
- Zero security incidents
- User delight score

## Development Philosophy
1. **Start simple**: Basic view-only dashboard
2. **Iterate quickly**: Ship weekly updates
3. **Listen to usage**: Track what's actually viewed/used
4. **Optimize ruthlessly**: Every millisecond counts
5. **Delight in details**: Small touches make the difference
